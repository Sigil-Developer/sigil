What is Sigil?
-----------------

Sigil is a new and revolutionary cryptocurrency that embodies the twin ideals of security and efficiency. It incorporates the best features of both Proof of Work and Proof of Stake mining, supports multiple algorithms, and achieves enhanced security through its implementation of advanced checkpointing and retargeting throughout.

The Sigil team is developing the next generation of crowdfunding technology through the blockchain. Our goal is to provide a more efficient, transparent, and secure crowdfunding platform without taking any fees whatsoever, instead using Sigil to fund the venture. We believe we can empower the individual specifically with this platform, as it will be beneficial for all parties involved. Consumers will be allowed to retain a greater portion of any funds they raise and any transaction intended for them will be ensured through the use of the blockchain.
